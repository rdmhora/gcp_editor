# gcp_editor
Is a script to help edit gcp points in the drone images. Is missing some interface implementations but is working for DJI images. 


Fo use it just run the Gcp_Editor_v1.py.

Add Images and GCP file in format: Point_Name E N Z. This coordinates must be in WGS84 UTM. Than Click in Run. After that a list with GCP will be displayed. By clicking in GCP point a list with images that contain each GCP will appear in Image List. Click on the image a Image will appear in the Scene Below. Thant just click where the GCP is on the image and go to the another image. After doing for every image just click in Save. 

I hope you got it.
